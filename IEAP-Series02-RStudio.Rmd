# 1 Statistical tests: comparison of medians (or means?)

In this series of exercises, you will explore how to compare two groups of data, using non-parametric tests (or parametric tests… if it makes sense to do so).

## 1.1 Make clear what is a statistical test, and when to use it.

Below are some questions to guide your analysis. You can answer them in your notebook, with a short sentence for each question.

**What is a median? A mean?**

**What is a variance? A standard deviation?**

**What is a normal distribution?**

**What is a statistical test?**

**When to use a statistical test?**

**What is a parametric test? A non-parametric test?**

**What are the assumptions of parametric tests?**

**What are the assumptions of non-parametric tests?**

**What is a p-value?**

**What is the risk of error when using a statistical test?**

**What is the difference between a paired and an unpaired test?**

You can use your favorite LLM, book or web site to answer these questions, but you have to provide at least one reference for each answer (book, article, URL, LLM prompt, etc.).

## 1.2 Effect of treatment over time

**This is a very classical question in clinical or sport research: does a treatment-training have an effect over time?**

### 1.2.1 The data

**Download the file PrePost.csv**

**This file contains before/after measurements. The treatment is a rehabilitation training for individuals with cardiac conditions.**

**Before going further, you have to make clear what are the measured variables. What do they measure? What are the units? What are the possible values? What are the expected changes over rehabilitation.**


**What do each variables represent ?** 

*Perf appears to be a heart rate performance metric (in beat per minute) often included between 60 and 200, time indicate the timing of measurement either before or after. We could see a decreasing heart rate after a rehabilitation process.*

### 1.2.2 The analysis

**You want to know if the treatment has an effect on one or more of the measured variables.**

        Does the treatment have an effect?

        What comparison are you going to make?

        Which test will you use? Parametric or non-parametric?

        Which graph illustrates the effect of the treatment?

        What sentence will you write in your thesis to explain your result?

## 1.3 Testing some stereotypes

**Humans have stereotypes, some of them are probably true, some others are probably false (e.g., ref ).**

**Here, we will test stereotypes about snorers… among others.**

### 1.3.1 The data

**Download the file snore.txt**

**This file contains anthropometric and qualitative measurements (1 person per line).**

### 1.3.2 The analysis

**Do the data confirm the following stereotypes?**
**Are snorers fatter?**

**Do snorers drink or smoke more?**

**Are men fatter?**

**Do women smoke less?**

## From a more general perspective:

**Are there any correlations between variables?**
