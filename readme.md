# A minimal template for data analysis with RStudio

This is a minimal template for data analysis with RStudio, intended to researchers in human movement sciences that are new to RStudio.  

Cloning this template for each new data analysis problem should facilitate data analyses with RStudio and minimize potential errors.

# Features 
- A minimal RStudio project structure
- A R Markdown notebook with a minimal data analysis pipeline
- A `.gitignore` file to tell Git which files to share and not to share

# Usage (without Git)

- Download as a zip file (green button `< > Code` on the top right of the page)
- Expand the archive on your computer (e.g., in your `Download` folder).
- Rename the extracted folder with the name of your new project (e.g., `SeriesOO_analysis`).
- Move the new `SeriesOO_analysis` folder where it should be located (e.g., in your `Documents/CodeProjects/` directory)


# Usage (with Git)
As this is a template repository, you can clone it to your computer and use it as a starting point for your new data analysis project.
- Do exactly the same as above, plus... 
- Use GitHub-Desktop to create a new Git repository from the folder you just created.
  - Click on `File` > `New repository...` You will need to provide:
    - The name of your new project (e.g., `ECG_analysis`).
    - A short description of your project (e.g., `ECG analysis of 100 healthy individuals for my PhD`).
    - The path to the folder you just created (e.g., `Documents/CodeProjects/ECG_analysis`).
    - Choose None for the .gitignore file (this template already has a specific one).
    - Choose None for the License file (this template already has a GNU GPLv3 License).
